These questions will be answered with the accompanying Gradescope assignment. This assignment was created in a way that you should answer each question as it is presented to you. Please do not forget to submit every answer independently within Gradescope to ensure you do not lose any of your work."

    "For EEG data analysis, there are various decisions that need to be made when selecting an appropriate filter. All signals are corrupted by outside noise, and EEG data is particularly susceptible to noise from AC electronics, muscle movements, and skin conductance changes (sweat). Filtering allows us to get rid of some of the junk, but it is not magic. There is no substitute for collecting clean data. Filtering will also throw out some of the data we care about, and one of the goals is to minimize how much of the signal we are modifying.\n",

    "Epoching is the step of pre-processing where we segment the data into the chunks we care about. We are only interested in the brief periods of time the participant has seen the stimulus. When epoching data, we must decide how much data is worth keeping. Our data in this case are synthetic and not collected from an actual experiment. In reality, the nature of the experiment will determine the length of your epoch, but it's not uncommon to look at signals a few hundred milliseconds before event onset all the way out to 1000 milliseconds after onset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The window of time before the onset typically contains **baseline** information. Baseline activity should reflect task unrelated neurological activity that was can use to standardize each of our trials to. In traditional experiments, the baseline is often chosen during a time when participants are looking at a blank screen before they're presented with the next trial. Our synthetic example does not require baseline correction so we'll save that for next assignment.\n",
